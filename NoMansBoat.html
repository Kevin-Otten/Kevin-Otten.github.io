                            NoMansBoat is a civilization management game set in a large island filled sea. The goal of
                            the game is to keep your civilization alive through trading with or pillaging other islands,
                            looting resource sites and other interactions with the world around you.
                            You must survive through several challenging events with one final event winning you the game.

                        These represent the main story quests.

                        the final quest event makes the player win the game.
