						<u>The Game</u>
						</div>					
							This game was a Game Jam project made for the GMTK Game Jam 2020.
                            I made this together with a friend of mine who wanted to get into game development.
                            I ended up making all the code besides a couple of the effects that get applied onto the player.
                            <br>The theme of this game jam was "Out of control".
                            The way we implemented this theme is by applying random effects to the player.

							<u>Random Effects System</u>

						<ul>
							<li><hi>UI track</hi> to inform the player <hi>of upcoming effects</hi></li>
							<li><hi>List and timer system</hi> in the background <hi>that queues  and triggers the effects</hi></li>
						</ul>
						<summary>
						<hi>Summary:</hi><br>
						The main gimmick of the game is the effects system.
						<hi>It picks random effect from a list and puts them on a track at the top of the screen.</hi>
						<hi>When it reaches the end of the track the effect will be applied on the player.</hi>
						It is also possible for a double effect to trigger, 
						visualized by a second elements following closely behind the first.
						<hi>The UI elements are purely visual, in the background a timer / coroutine is used to trigger the actual effect.</hi>
						</summary>
					</p>
					<smaller><hi>Random effects in action</hi>, starting with a double effect being applied and another one being queued up</smaller>

						<summary>
						<hi>Summary:</hi><br>
						<hi>The input</hi> in this project <hi>is centralized</hi> in a single InputManager class.
						The benefit of a centralised system like this is <hi>to make input related bugs easier to find and solve</hi>.
						<br>
						<br>This was also <hi>one of the first player movement systems I made</hi>, 
						Previous attempt had several issues with physics and smooth movement which I intended to address in this one.
						To make the player move <hi>I modify the player's velocity instead of position</hi> which I had done in previous projects.
						This was <hi>to make sure movement takes better account of the physics of the game and avoid things like phasing through walls.</hi>
						I also <hi>switch out the physics material on the player to a material with less friction</hi>.
						This makes sure that they <hi>won't get stuck on small bumps or stick to walls</hi>.
						<hi>When the player stands still this material switches back to one with more friction.</hi>
						By doing this <hi>the player won't slide off slanted surfaces or slide as if the floor is ice.</hi>
